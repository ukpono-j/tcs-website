                                        brevity.</p>

                                    <p>The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a number of people
                                        with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran. The telegram concluded with the
                                        words: "Formidable as they seem to be, the Martians have not moved from the pit
                                        into which they have fallen, and, indeed, seem incapable of doing so. Probably
                                        this is due to the relative strength of the earth's gravitational energy." On

                                    <p>But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is also a
                                        fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own
                                        guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned. Like a savage
                                        tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes even
                                        the mightiest whales against the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with
                                        the split wrecks of ships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting
                                        and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless
                                        ocean overruns the globe.</p>

                                    <p>Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide under
                                        water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath the
                                        loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of
                                        many of its most remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many
                                        species of sharks. Consider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea;
                                        all whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the
                                        world began.</p>
